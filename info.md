3. Your professional pitch
  My name's Jed Staley, I'm a long time coding hobbyist, I made many websites and miniature applications in my off-time before I decided to enroll at Code Fellows to further hone my skills. This prior experience has given me a great window into the breadth of the industry, allowing me to make optimizations that many others would never be aware of. I have experience in the sales industry, which has uniquely equipped me with a very personal understanding of user needs when it comes to data presentation. At Code Fellows, I learned all aspects of full-stack development, including HTML5, CSS3, React, JavaScript, and Bash. I have extensive experience with team collaboration and Git-flow which, paired with my passion for communication, makes me a valuable asset to the team. I take great care in my communication, both written and verbal, and strive to pass that care on to my teammates as well, effectively bolstering the whole team, increasing efficiency and productivity, as well as vastly improving the team environment.
4. What excites you the most about tech?
